## Anti-Cheat and Antivirus software

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software.

**READ IF PLAYING ONLINE GAMES AND/OR GAMES THAT HAVE ANTI-CHEAT ENABLED**

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software. This could result in interference
or issues in games that use anti-cheat technology (including the possibility of a suspension or ban).

Application by default does not use any kernel-level features. If you request a change
that might trigger anti-cheat detection application does require to acknowledge this.

### Safe settings

If you play online games application needs to disable kernel-features.
**Those settings should be considered safe**:

- **Fan Control**: Use **Default** FAN
- **Performance Overlay**: OSD Kernel Drivers are **DISABLED**

### Features missing without Kernel Drivers

By disabling usage of Kernel Drivers you are loosing the:

- **Fan Control**: Optimised `SteamOS` FAN curve
- **Performance Overlay**: See CPU % and MHz, GPU MHz, APU W usage
- **Power Control**: Ability to change TDP, CPU and GPU frequency - you can change this safely before you start the game
- **Steam Controller**: There's no impact

## Supported devices

The application tries it best to not harm device (just in case).
So, it validates bios version. Those are currently supported:

- SteamDeck LCD:

  - F7A0107 (PD ver: 0xB030)
  - F7A0110 (PD ver: 0xB030)
