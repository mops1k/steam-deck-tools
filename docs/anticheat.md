it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software.

**READ IF PLAYING ONLINE GAMES AND/OR GAMES THAT HAVE ANTI-CHEAT ENABLED**

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software. This could result in interference
or issues in games that use anti-cheat technology (including the possibility of a suspension or ban).

Application by default does not use any kernel-level features. If you request a change
that might trigger anti-cheat detection application does require to acknowledge this.
